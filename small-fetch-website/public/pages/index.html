		 This is an example page about cookies. So this section will mostly be about cookies. <br />
		 Whats there to say about cookies ? Lets see... Cookies are great because they taste good, especialy when they are poured
		 with chocolate, or maybe vanilla, but mostly chocolate makes them taste better. <br /> I'am tempted to go on wikipedia and 
		 do an good ol' copy paste but this feels more natural. Lets continue... <br />
		 Cookies can be crunchy. When you feel that taste, humans (somethimes dogs) close their eyes and enjoy the crunchyness flavor.
		 It can be used in medicine, when a person is depressed, it offers some resistance.
